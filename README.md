# Jungle Vote

JungleVote is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. It allows animals to participate in fair and transparent elections in the jungle, where they can vote for their preferred candidates without fear of manipulation or fraud.

## How to use JungleVote

To use JungleVote, you'll need to have the following:

- A compatible Ethereum wallet (such as Metamask) installed on your browser
- Some Ether (ETH) to pay for transaction fees

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open the JungleVote dApp in your browser.
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet to the dApp.
3. Register as a candidate by submitting your name, species, and a brief description of your platform.
4. Wait for your candidacy to be approved by the admin (who is also an animal).
5. Register as a voter by submitting your name, species, and a unique identifier (such as a paw print).
6. Wait for your voter registration to be approved by the admin.
7. Wait for the election to be announced.
8. Vote for your preferred candidate using your unique voter ID.
9. Wait for the election results to be announced.

## Smart contracts

JungleVote is powered by Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are the main contracts used in the app:

- `JungleVote`: the main contract that handles the election process, including candidate and voter registration, vote casting, and result tallying.
- `Animal`: a contract that defines the properties of an animal (such as name and species), and is used by both the candidate and voter contracts.
